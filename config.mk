# Direct use of any form new, delete, std::construct_at, std::uninitialized_move, manual destructor calls, etc are prohibited. Manual memory and object lifetime management is relegated to unsafe code.

# Messing with aliasing is prohibited: no reinterpret_cast or __restrict language extensions allowed. Bytewise inspection of data can be accomplished through std::span<std::byte> with some modification

# Intentionally invoking undefined behavior is also not allowed - this means no [[assume()]], std::assume_aligned, or std::unreachable().

# Only calls to functions with well-defined behavior for all inputs is allowed. This is considerably more restrictive than it may appear. This requires a new function attribute, [[trusted]] would be my preference but a [[safe]] function attribute proposal already exists for aiding in interop with Rust etc and I see no point in making two function attributes with identical purposes of marking functions as okay to be called from safe code.

# any use of a potentially moved-from object before re-assignment is not allowed? I'm not sure how easy it is to enforce this one.

# No pointer arithmetic allowed.

# no implicit narrowing conversions allowed (static_cast is required there)
