I have, like many others competitors, written a script to reduce time preparing the problem's solution.

**Dependencies:**

+ [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/);
+ [git](https://git-scm.com/);
+ [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd).

## Notes

1. Enviroment variables used:
   + `EDITOR`, like [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/);
   + `READER`, like [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/).
